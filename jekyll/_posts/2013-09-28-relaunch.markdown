Years ago I took down my blog because I was so unsatisfied with
wordpress. In these years I started about 5 times to write my own
git-based blog-engine and about 5 times I stopped after making
considerable progress (mostly because it was too hard to integrate
comments). This time the urge to restart my blog is finally
overpowering my chronic nii-syndrome and I decided to use
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as a blog-engine and add some git-hook-magic myself.

The layout is still pretty shitty, it's the default of jekyll, but I
wanted to put it online before seing my efforts die again on such
minor details.

So this is finally the relaunch of my blog. Yay for me.
