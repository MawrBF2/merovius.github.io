**tl;dr: "Some marbles, apparently, have a gender. And they seem to be overwhelmingly male."**

A couple of days ago [The MarbleLympics 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-RXmnw758NH0bj5KIbpiDrLygvT7k9un)
popped into my twitter stream. In case you are unaware (I certainly was): It's
a series of videos where a bunch of marbles participate in a made-up Olympics.
They are split into teams that then participate in a series of "competitions"
in a variety of different events. The whole event is professionally filmed, cut
and overlaid both with fake noises from spectators and a well-made, engaging
sports commentary. It is *really* fun to watch. I don't know why, but I find it
*way* more captivating than watching actual sports. I thoroughly recommend it.

Around event 8 (high jump) though, I suddenly noticed that the commentator
would *occasionally* not only personify but actually gender marbles.  For most
of the commentary he just refers to the teams as a whole with a generic "they".
But every once in a while - and especially often during the high-jump event -
he would use a singular gendered pronoun. Also, that only really occurred to me
when he referred to one of the marbles as "she".

This instantly became one of those things that after noticing it, I
couldn't *unnotice* it. It's not so much that it *matters*. But from then on, I
couldn't stop listening up every time a singular pronoun was used.

Well, you know where this is going. Fully aware of how much of a waste of my
time this is, I sat down and counted. More specifically, I downloaded the
closed captions of all the videos and grepped through them for pronouns. I
*did* double-check all findings and here is what I found: By my count, 20
distinct marbles are referred to by singular pronouns (yes. I noted their names
to filter duplicates. Also I kind of hoped to find a genderfluid marble to be
honest). Here is an alphabetized list of gendered marbles:

* Aqua (Oceanics) - Male
* Argent (Quicksilvers) - Male
* Clementin (O'Rangers) - Male
* Cocoa (Chocolatiers) - Male (in two events)
* Cosmo (Team Galactic) - Male
* Imar (Primaries) - Male
* Jump (Jungle Jumpers) - Male
* Leap (Jungle Jumpers) - Male
* Mandarin (O'Rangers) - Male (in two events)
* Mary (Team Primary) - Female
* Mercurial (Quicksilvers) - Male
* Mimo (Team Momo) - Male
* Momo Momo (Team Momo) - Male (in three events)
* Pinky Winky (Pinkies) - Male
* Rapidly (Savage Speeders) - Male
* Taffy (Jawbreakers) - Male
* Wespy (Midnight Wisps) - Male
* Whizzy (Savage Speeders) - Male
* Yellah (Mellow Yellow) - Male
* Yellup (Mellow Yellow) - Male

As you can see, the overwhelming majority of gendered marbles are men. There is
exactly one exception: Mary. From what I can tell, that's because it's the
only name that has clear gender associations. All the other names probably
could go either way. And marbles obviously *have* no gender. They are as
non-gendered an object as you could imagine. And yet there seems to be a
default assumption that athletic marbles would be men.

Obviously this doesn't matter. Obviously you can't discriminate marbles.
You can't misgender them or hurt their feelings. Obviously the commentator
didn't sit down and made a list of all the marbles and assigned 95% of them a
male gender - it's clearly just an ad-hoc subconscious assignment. And to be
absolutely clear: I do not try to fault the makers of these videos *at all*.
They did nothing wrong. It's a ludicrous expectation for them to sit down and
make sure that they assign balanced genders to their marbles.

But I do find it an interesting observation. I do think it reflects an
implicit, unconscious bias in a striking way. I also think it illustrates
nicely that gender bias in language isn't exclusive to languages like German,
where all nouns are gendered (take note, German friends). Of course none of
this is news. This kind of unconscious gender bias in language is
well-researched and documented. It's just that once you know about it, you
can't stop noticing the evidence for it popping up *everywhere*. Even with
marbles.

And all of that being said: Yes, I am also aware that all of this is slightly
ridiculous.

PS: In case the team behind the MarbleLympics are reading this: Really, thank
you for the videos :) They are great.
