**tl:dr: We made a [gamejam-game](https://entropia.de/GPN14:GameJam:CrazyCatLady)**

At the GPN14 we (meaning me and Lea, with a bit of help by sECuRE) participated
in the [gamejam](https://entropia.de/GPN14:GameJam). It was the first time for
us both, I did all the coding and Lea provided awesome graphics.

The [result](https://entropia.de/GPN14:GameJam:CrazyCatLady) is a small
minigame “crazy cat lady”, where you throw cats at peoples faces and - if you
hit - scratch the shit out of them (by hammering the spacebar). The game
mechanics are kind of limited, but the graphics are just epic, in my opinion:

Because sounds make every game 342% more awesome, we added a creative commons
licensed
[background-music](http://freemusicarchive.org/music/fp/traces/05_fp_-_trace_5).
We also wanted some cat-meowing and very angry pissed of hissing, which was
more of a problem to come by. Our solution was to just wander about the GPN and
asking random nerds to make cat sounds and recording them. That gave a pretty
cool result, if you ask me.

On the technical side we used [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), an open 2D game
engine for lua, widely used in gamejams. I am pretty happy with this engine,
it took about 3 hours to get most of the game-mechanics going, the rest was
pretty much doing the detailed animations. It is definitely not the nicest or
most efficient code, but for a gamejam it is a well suited language and engine.

If you want to try it (I don't think it is interesting for more than a few
minutes, but definitely worth checking out), you should install LÖVE (most
linux-distributions should have a package for that) and just
[download](http://merovius.de/crazycatlady.love) it, or check out the
[sourcecode](https://github.com/Merovius/crazycatlady).

We did not make first place, but that is okay, the game that won is a nice game
and a deserved winner. We had a lot of fun and we are all pretty happy with the
result as first-timers.
