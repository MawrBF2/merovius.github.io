title: A day in the life of an Omnivore
summary: I take a toung-in-cheek look at how I imagine the life of a meat eater to look.
  At least based on my own experience.

You get an E-Mail. It's an invite to a team dinner. As you have only recently
joined this team, it's going to be your first. How exciting! You look forward
to get to know your new coworkers better and socialize outside the office. They
are nice and friendly people and you are sure it's going to be a great evening.
However, you also have a distinct feeling of anxiety and dread in you. Because
you know, the first dinner with new people also means you are going to have
the conversation again. You know it will come up, whether you want to or not.
Because you had it a thousand times - because you are an Omnivore.

You quickly google the place your manager suggested. "Green's Organic
Foodery".  They don't have a menu on their site, but the name alone makes
clear, that meat probably isn't their specialty, exactly. You consider asking
for a change of restaurant, but quickly decide that you don't want to get a
reputation as a killjoy who forces their habits on everyone just yet. You
figure they are going to have *something* with meat on their menu. And if
not, you can always just grab a burger on your way home or throw a steak into
a pan when you get back.  You copy the event to your calendar and continue
working.

At six, everyone gathers to go to dinner together. It's not far, so you decide
to just walk. On the way you get to talk to some of your team mates. You talk
about Skiing, your home countries, your previous companies. You are having fun -
they seem to be easy-going people, you are getting along well. It's going to be
an enjoyable night.

You arrive at the restaurant and get seated. The waiter arrives with the menu
and picks up your orders for drinks. When they leave, everyone starts flipping
through the menu. “You've got to try their Tofu stir-fry. It's amazing”, Kevin
tells you. You nod and smile and turn your attention to the booklet in your
hand. You quickly take in the symbols decorating some of the items. “G” - safe
to assume, these are the gluten-free options. There's also an “O” on a bunch of
them. Also familiar, but ambiguous - could be either “Omnivores" or “Ovo-lacto”
(containing at least dairy products or eggs), you've seen both usages. There is
no legend to help disambiguate and quickly flipping through the rest of the
menu, you find no other symbols. Ovo-lacto, then. You are going to have to
guess from the names and short descriptions alone, whether they also contain any
meat. They have lasagna, marked with an “O”. Of course that's probably just the
cheese but they *might* make it with actual minced beef.

The waiter returns and takes your orders. “The lasagna - what kind is it?”, you
ask. You are trying to avoid the O-word as long as you can. “It's Lasagna alla
Bolognese, house style”. Uh-oh. House style? “Is it made from cattle, or based
on gluten proteins?” (you don't care how awkward you have to phrase your
question, you are *not* saying the magic trigger words!) “Uhm… I'm not sure. I
can ask in the kitchen, if you'd like?” “That would be great, thanks”. They
leave. Jen, from across the table, smiles at you - are you imagining it, or
does it look slightly awkward? You know the next question. “Are you an
Omnivore?” “I eat meat, yes”, you say, smiling politely. Frick. Just *one*
meal, is all you wanted. But it had to come up at some point anyway, so fine.
“Wow. I'm Ovo-lacto myself. But I couldn't always eat meat, I think. Is it hard?”
You notice that your respective seat neighbors have started to listen too.
Ovo-lactos aren't a rarity anymore (Onmivores a bit more so, but not *that*
much), but the topic still seems interesting enough to catch attention. You've
seen it before. What feels like a hundred thousand times. In fact, you have
said exactly the same thing Jen just said, just a year or so ago. Before you
just decided to go Omnivore.

“Not really”, you start. “I found it not much harder than when I went
Ovo-lacto. You have to get used to it, of course, and pay a little more
attention, but usually you find something. Just like when you start eating
cheese and eggs.” At that moment, the waiter returns. “I spoke to the chef and
we can make the lasagna with beef, if you like”. “Yes please”, you hand the
menu back to them with a smile. “I considered going Ovo-lacto”, Mike continues
the conversation from the seat next to Jen, “but for now I just try to have
some milk every once in a while. Like, in my coffee or cereal. It's not that I
don't *like* it, there are really great dairy products. For example, this place
in the city center makes this *amazing* yogurt. But having it every day just
seems very hard“. “Sure”, you simply say. You know they mean well and you don't
want to offend them by not being interested; but you also heard these exact
literal words at least two dozen times. And always with ample evidence in the
room that it's not actually *that* hard.

“I don't really see the point”, Roy interjects from the end of the table. You
make a mental check-mark. “Shouldn't people just eat what they want? I don't
get why suddenly we all have to like meat”. It doesn't matter that no one
suggested that. “I mean, I do think it's cool if people eat meat”, someone
whose name you don't remember adds, “I sometimes think I should eat more eggs
myself. But it's just so annoying that you get these Omnivores who try to
lecture you about how unhealthy it is to not eat meat or that humans are
naturally predisposed to digest meat. I mean, you seem really relaxed about it”,
they quickly add as assurance in your direction, “but you can't deny that there
are also these Omni-nazis”. You sip on your water, mentally counting backwards
from 3. “You know how you find an Omnivore at a party?”, Kevin asks jokingly
from your right. “Don't worry, they will tell you”, Rick delivers the punchline
for him. How original.

”I totally get Omnivores. If they want to eat meat, that's great. What I don't
understand is this weird trend of fake-salad. Like, people get a salad, but
then they put french dressing on it, or bacon bits. I mean, if you want a
salad, why not just simply have a salad?”. You know the stupidly obvious answer
of course and you haven't talked in a while, so you decide to steer the
conversation into a more pleasant direction. “It's simple, really. You like
salad, right?” “Yeah, of course“ “So, if you like salad, but decide that you
also want to eat dairy or meat - doesn't it make sense to get as close to a
pure salad as you can? While still staying with your conviction to eat meat?
It's a tradeoff, sure, but isn't it better than *no* salad at all?” There's a
brief pause. You can tell that they haven't considered that before. No one has.
Which you find baffling. Every single time. “Hm. I guess I haven't thought
about it like that before. From that point of view it does kind of make sense.
Anyway, I still prefer the real deal”. “That's fine”, you say, smiling “I will
continue to eat my salad with french dressing”.

Your food arrives and the conversation continues for a bit, with the usual
follow-up questions - do you eat pork too, or just beef? What about dogs? Would
you consider eating monkey meat? Or Human? You explain that you don't worry
about the exact line, that you are not dogmatic about it and usually just
decide based on convenience and what seems obvious (and in luckily, these
questions don't usually need an answer in practice anyway). Someone brings up
how some of what's labeled as milk actually is made from almonds, because it's
cheaper, so you can't even be sure you actually get dairy. But slowly, person
by person, the topic shifts back to work, hobbies and family. “How's the
lasagna?”, Jen asks. “Great”, you reply with a smile, because it is.

On your way home, you take stock. Overall, the evening went pretty well. You
got along great with most of your coworkers and had long, fun conversations.
The food ended up delicious, even if you wish they had just properly labeled
their menu. You probably are going to have to nudge your team on future
occasions, so you go out to Omnivore-friendlier places. But you are also pretty
sure they are open to it. Who knows, you might even get them to go to a steak
house at some point. You know you are inevitably going to have the conversation
again, at some point - whether it will come up at another meal with your team
or with a new person, who you eat with for the first time. This time, at least,
it went reasonably well.
