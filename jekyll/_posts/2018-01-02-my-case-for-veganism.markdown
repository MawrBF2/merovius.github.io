title: "My case for veganism"
tldr: "I make a case for veganism and why you probably already agree with all the reasons you should be vegan. And how I wish people would reframe the topic, to make it less contentious, emotional and, frankly, annoying."

I'm going to try to make an argument for being vegan, but, to be clear, it is
not very likely to convince you to change your eating habits. It is not
designed to - it is only supposed to change the way you think about it. I
mention all of that, so you are aware that *I don't care* what your conclusions
are here. If you are reading this, you should do so out of a genuine interest
of my motives and for the purpose of self-reflection - not to pick a fight with
that vegan dude and really show him he's wrong. I will not debate the content
of this article with you. So, with that out of the way, here is a thought
experiment:

> Say, we would live in a Star Trek like post-scarcity society. Energy is all
> but abundant and we figured out replicator-technology, that can instantly
> create anything we like out of it. You get offer the choice between two
> meals, one is a delicious steak dinner (or whatever), made in a traditional
> manner. The second is the same thing, but from a replicator. Both are
> indistinguishable, they taste the same, they have the same nutritional and
> chemical composition, they cost the same. *They only differ in how they're
> made.*

You might be trying to rules-lawyer this. You might be trying to make up an
argument, for why the replicator-steak would *have* to be worse. Or that the
cow would already be dead, so it wouldn't matter. But that is obviously not the
point of this thought experiment (and remember, you don't have to convince
anyone of being right, here). The point is, that I strongly believe that the
vast majority of people would agree, that *all things being equal*, choosing
the meal that no animal suffered for is *the correct choice*. And if you truly
believe that it isn't, if you can honestly say to yourself that it doesn't
matter: You won't gain anything from the rest of this article. You are relieved
and might now just as well stop reading.

The point I am trying to make, is that you probably already know all the
reasons you *should* be vegan. It's very likely that you already have an
intuitive understanding of all the reasons in the "pro veganism" column of your
pro/contra list. And it really shouldn't be necessary to convince you it's a
good idea, in general.

Why then, do so few people actually *choose* to be vegan, if they are fully
aware of all the reasons to do so? The obvious answer is: Because not all
things *are* being equal. There is a "contra veganism" column and it's filled
with many good reasons *not* to. What reasons those are, is deeply individual.
It might be due to health. Due to an appeal to nature. Convenience. Money.
Availability. Taste. Or maybe just priorities: Other things seem more important
and deserving of your energy. *And that's okay*. We all have to make hundreds
of decisions every day and weigh these kinds of questions. And sometimes we do
things that we shouldn't and we usually have good reasons to. And sometimes we
compromise and don't go *all the way*, but just do the best we feel able to and
that's fine too. Nobody has to be perfect all the time.

The reason, I'm writing this article anyway, is that there is a fundamental
difference between the two questions "Why are you vegan?" and "Why are you not
*not* vegan?". When you ask me why I am vegan, you are making the conversation
inherently about my values and you will usually end up attacking them - not
because you disagree with them (you likely are not), but just because that's
the natural progression of this question. And to be absolutely clear: I don't
owe you a justification for my value system. I'm sorry if that sounds harsh,
but the topic is mostly
[really annoying](/2017/10/20/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-omnivore.html)
to me (as hard as that may be to believe at this point).

A more sensible question, though, is to ask how to best *mitigate the
contra*-column. If we agree that, fundamentally, the points in the pro-column
are valid and shared reasons, we can proceed into the much more productive
conversation about how much weight the downsides really have and how you might
be able to reduce at least some of their impact. And, again to be clear: The
outcome of that might very well be, that your reasons are completely valid,
rational and that, applied to your personal situation, veganism wouldn't be a
good choice. (And to be also clear: I might not be in the mood to have *this*
conversation either. But it's much preferable).

So, what I wish people to take away from this is

1. Stop asking why you should be vegan (or why I am), you more than likely
   already know. If you are really interested in making an informed choice,
   bring up your concerns instead, but also accept if I don't want to talk
   about them at that particular time - it's a lot of emotional labor, to give
   the same explanations repeatedly. It might not seem like a big deal to me,
   to ask these questions, but I've repeated most of my answers literally
   hundreds of times at this point and might prefer to just enjoy my food.
2. Stop treating veganism as a *preference* and start treating it as a *moral
   choice*. There is a qualitative difference between someone who does not like
   Italian food and a vegan. This is interesting when choosing what or where to
   eat as a group: This is hard enough as it is and I at least usually try very
   hard to accommodate everyone and not be a burden. And I absolutely do not
   expect to be treated like I'm better for that. But if it actually would come
   down to a choice between a vegetarian restaurant or a steakhouse, just
   because you really like meat: Yes, I do absolutely expect us to avoid the
   steakhouse. (To be clear: In my experience, it rarely *actually* comes down
   to only those two choices. And there are good reasons to avoid vegetarian
   restaurants that are not based on preference which should be given ample
   weight too - e.g. someone I know has Coeliac disease, fructose intolerance
   and lactose intolerance and tends to have a very hard time eating non-meat
   things. In my experience, though, people who have needs and not just
   preferences tend to ironically be more open to compromise anyway, so it is
   less often a problem with them).
3. Maybe think about your reasons for not being vegan and evaluate them
   seriously. To be clear, this is a stretch-goal and not the actual point of
   this article.

And if you want to, you can watch someone who does eat meat say *essentially*
the same things here:

#### Reasons I'm not *not* vegan

Now, the main point of this post is dedicated to the general question of "how I
think about the topic and how I believe you should think about it too". But I
also want it to serve as a reference of my personal, specific thoughts driving
my decision - so if you don't know me well or are not interested in my personal
reasons, this would be a good place to close the tab and do something else.

I'm still writing this, because I hope this can be the last thing I ever have
to write about this (yeah, lol). Because again, I don't actually *like*
discussing it, as unbelievable as that may seem. So here is, as a reference,
why *I* am vegan (and I might add to/change this list over time, when my
viewpoints evolve). Why, after ten-ish years of thinking "I *should* be vegan,
butâ€¦", I decided to make the switch - or at least give it a serious try. So,
this is a list of reasons I gave to myself to justify not going vegan and why
they stopped being convincing *to me*. Your mileage may vary.

##### Meat/Cheese/Eggs/Bailey's is awesome and I can't imagine giving it up.

For most of my life I didn't think about vegetarianism or veganism at all.
Eating meat was the default, so that's what I did. When I did start to think
about it, I convinced myself that I couldn't give up meat, because most of
my favorite foods where meat-based. However, a lot of people in my
peer-group around that time (university) where vegetarian or vegan, so I
naturally got into contact with a lot of good food that *wasn't* naturally
meat-based. So I started eating less and less meat - and the less meat I
ate, the more I realized I didn't really *miss* it that much, given how much
good alternatives there are. Eventually I decided to become a "flexitarian",
which very quickly (in ~1-2 months) became "vegetarian", when I realized
that it didn't actually bother me to not eat meat at all - and making that
commitment meant less decisions, so it made things easier. With
Cheese/Eggs/Bailey's, I basically went through exactly the same transition,
six or seven years later: "I can't imagine giving them up" - "Actually,
there are really good alternatives" - "Let's just try reducing it and see
how far I get" - "Meh, might as well just commit completely".

So, to me, giving up animal products just turned out much easier, than
expected, when I actually tried. And I'm not saying I don't *miss* them,
every once in a while, I will still look longingly at a steak or think
fondly of my scrambled eggs. But for the most part, the alternatives are
just as great (or at times better), so it isn't *as* big a sacrifice as
expected.

##### Being vegetarian/vegan is unhealthy.

There is a bunch of research about this and for a while (especially before
actually looking into the details) the health implications of veganism
(vegetarianism not so much) did concern me. But, it turns out, this topic is
pretty complicated. Nutrition research is *very hard* - and that manifests
in the fact that for most of it, the statistical significance is usually low
and the effect sizes usually small. Now, I'm not *denying*, that there are
health downsides to a vegan diet. But even *with* the general mess that
nutritional research is, it doesn't seem very controversial that if you are
concerned for your health, there are much more important factors to
consider. If weighed against the health benefits of sleeping more, doing
more sports, not sitting all day, stop recreational drug use, taking
extensive vacationsâ€¦ (neither of which I seem to be willing to do, even
though they would be easy enough), the relatively minor health effects of
eating animal products (contrasted with a somewhat balanced vegan diet plus
supplementation) just did not seem to be a relevant driving force for that
decision and more of a rationalization.

That being said, from what I can gather so far, there is a general consensus
that if a) you pay attention to having a somewhat balanced diet and b) are
willing to supplement the nutrients you *can't* actually get, the health
impact of veganism is pretty low, if any. Personally, I am supplementing
Vitamins B12 and D right now, which has very low quality of life impact - so
I don't consider that a significant downside. I also pay a little bit more
attention to what I'm eating, which I consider a good thing.

If it turns out that I can not sustain a vegan diet, I will reconsider it,
but for now, I don't see any realistic danger of that happening.

##### It is cumbersome to know whether or not something is vegan.

This is mostly true. As a vegetarian, this mostly revolved around looking
for gelatin in the ingredients of sweets and asking in a restaurant whether
"Lasagna" is made with meat or not. Being a vegan does involve a *lot* of
scanning ingredients-lists of basically every product I buy. Though I'm
positively surprised how many vendors are recently starting to choose to get
their products [certified](https://www.v-label.eu/) - and not only brands
you would expect to focus on that, but also, increasingly, all kinds of
mainstream products.

That being said, there *is* an availability issue (especially around "may
contain traces ofâ€¦", which is basically saying "if you are allergic, we
can't rule out cross-contamination of other things from the same factory").
I tend to be pragmatic about this: If I have the choice, I will buy the
certifiably vegan option, otherwise I'm also fine with traces of animal
products, personally. If I don't know, I will go with my best guess and how
I feel in the moment.

This is definitely the most true and heavy argument still on the contra-side
for me, but being kind of pragmatic about it helps alleviate most of the
pain.

##### It's hypocritical to draw the line at X and not at Y.

You can always be more rigorous and there are a lot of line-drawing
questions that come up when thinking about vegetarianism/veganism. For the
record, a lot of that is just plain nonsense, but there are some
legitimate questions to be asked around whether or not insects count, for
example, or certain shellfish, whether you would eat meat if it would be
thrown away otherwise or would eat an egg, if the Hen laying it was living a
happy, free life. In the end, the vast majority of things you can eat will
involve *some* harm to the environment or animals and you won't always know,
so where do you draw the line?

Personally, I decided that *definite* harm is worse than *potential* harm
and *more* harm is worse than *less* harm. "It is hypocritical to not eat
meat/cheese/eggs but still kill a wasp entering your apartment" is about as
convincing an argument to me as "it is hypocritical to eat meat/cheese/eggs
but not also eat dogs/jellyfish/human". The world isn't black-and-white and
it's fine to choose a gray spot in the middle that makes you comfortable.

##### Eating out becomes a PITA.

Yes. Going out and eating in a group is a PITA. Honestly, there are no two
ways about it. I do have to actively make sure that a chosen food place has
options for me and more often than not that does involve making special
requests and/or making do with less great meals.

In general, this still works reasonably well. The cafeteria at work has
*great* vegan options most of the time, Zurich has an amazing choice of
great restaurants for vegans to offer, most other restaurants can accommodate
too and even if not, I'm fine just eating a little thing and then later eat
some more at home.

The main problem is working around the social issues associated with it -
dealing with people who are unwilling to be accommodating, having to
justify/discuss my choice or just exposing something about my person I might
prefer to keep private. Basically, I wrote
[a whole thing about this](/2017/10/20/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-omnivore.html).

But this is simply one of those downsides I chose to accept. Nobody said
going vegan wouldn't come with sacrifices.

##### Being vegan is expensive

I am not sure this is true *in general*. I am relatively sure, that being
vegetarian at least actually ended up *saving* me money as a student. But I
can't be completely certain, as the change also came with other changes in
circumstances. My vegan diet is *probably* more expensive than my vegetarian
one, mainly because it includes a lot more processed substitute products
("faux meat" and various plant milks, which are at least in Switzerland
still significantly more expensive than the cow-based variants), but again,
I didn't actually run any numbers.

I'm pretty sure it's possible to have an affordable vegan diet, especially
if limiting processed substitute products and not eating out so often.
Luckily, this isn't really a concern for me, right now, though. Food and
Groceries is a *relatively* small proportion of my monthly expenses and as
such, the impact this has on me is pretty limited either way.

I convinced myself, that if I can afford spending money on all kinds of
luxury items and electronic gadgets, I can probably afford spending a little
more on food.
